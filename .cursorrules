# Shadow Economy Development Guidelines

## Commit Strategy
- Maximum 500 lines of code per commit to comply with ETH Online guidelines
- Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- Commit frequently with small, atomic changes

## Code Style
- UI should feel organic and human-designed, not AI-generated
- Prefer clean, minimal interfaces over complex animations
- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment complex cryptographic operations

## Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all smart contracts before deployment
- Test bot encryption/decryption flows thoroughly
- Validate EVVM integration with testnet before mainnet

## Documentation Standards
- Update README.md when adding new features
- Document all public contract functions with NatSpec
- Include setup instructions for new dependencies
- Keep architecture.md in sync with implementation

## Security Practices
- Never commit private keys or sensitive credentials
- Use .env files for configuration (excluded from git)
- Review all Lit Protocol encryption flows
- Validate async nonce collision handling

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement with small commits
3. Test locally with EVVM testnet
4. Update documentation
5. Submit PR with clear description
